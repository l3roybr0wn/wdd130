        <p>Hey Friends, I am Levi Rich. I am from Utah. I was born and raised in the Ogden area and living in West
            Point,
            Utah.
            I am happily married to my best friend, Krystal, and have five wonderful children. I always have some hobby
            that I
            am doing, namely Pokemon, Dungeons and Dragons, and listening to music. I have a deep love for imagination
            and creating
            content for the things that I love. </p>
